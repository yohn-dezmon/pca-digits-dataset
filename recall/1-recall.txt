you can scale the dataset by using sklearn 

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler()
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_X = scaler.fit_transform(digits_pixels)

the originanl dataset has each column as a pixel value, where each cell 
is the value for an 8x8 matrix, and the final column is the number that 
was identified. 

So to do the PCA, we have to remove the final column.

matplotlib.imshow() on a 2D array makes the color image. 
plt.show()

to get a single row into a 2D array first you extact a single row:
df.iloc[0]

then you convert to np array:
single_row.to_numpy()

then you convert to 2d array:
np.reshape(np_array, (8,8))
